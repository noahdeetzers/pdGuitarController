# pdGuitarController
A guitar controller using Pure Data and TouchOSC

This was a Pure Data project creating a guitar controller that could adjust various parameters on a plugin through OSC.
The guitar controller was an iPhone using TouchOSC that transmitted OSC data to be parsed by a PD patch.
It allowed for custom remapping of parameters, and the inclusion of more continuous parameters like IMU data.
